# ifconfig.network

A simple site that returns your external ip address. Designed to be free, fast, open-source, without tracking or ads.

This project exists to scratch an itch. I regularly need to know my internet ip (when behind a NAT firewall) and I got fed up with the ad-ridden sites that provide that info. I have been using ifconfig.me for a while but it was slow(!) and not always up. I know there are a lot of these sites out there but I kept forgetting their urls and/or syntax. So here we are. Easy to use and remember, fast, free and open source.

Example use:
```
curl ifconfig.network
wget -qO- ifconfig.network
```

https://ifconfig.network is also available but SSL is not enforced.

Enjoy!
